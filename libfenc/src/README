LIBFENC -- The Fenc Library

Overview

The Fenc Library, libfenc, is an extensible library implementing several functional encryption schemes.
See the INSTALL text file for instructions on how to build libfenc for your particular environment;
the NEWS text file for latest version changes, and; AUTHORS if you're interested in the latest contributions.

See the online wiki for more information. The source files and pdf(s) found in the ./manual ./papers directories
contain more in-depth details of current and background information.

The Fenc library is released under the Open Source Initiative OSI - BSD License. See the
file COPYING for details.

------------------------

The remainder of this file contains a possibly dated list of TODO(s), build notes, and error logs.

  TODO: 
     * Decode/Encode plaintexts to GT
     * The NM (negated attributes) functionality isn't working
       - Figure out the N() function and NM() functions
     * Decode attribute policies from strings
     * Plaintext/ciphertext structures should be more abstract
     * Hashing currently assumes element_t (Zr) structs

  MDG_NOTES:
    To build PBC on MacOS Leopard, 64-bit:

    * Get the latest version of gmp, make sure configure is using it
    * Copy "gmp.h" into this directory and comment out the following line:

      #define __GMP_EXTERN_INLINE extern __inline__ __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__))
      (I've already done it in this directory.)

    * At the command line, set "CPPFLAGS" and "CFLAGS" to "-m64"
      (in an earlier version, this was "-m64 -arch x86_64", but doesn't work now)

    * Make clean and re-configure.

    * It may be necessary to manually edit the Makefiles including ./example
      and ./gen to include the "-m64" directive in the CFLAGS definition.
      I'm sure there's a way to get Configure to do this automatically,
      I'm just too lazy to figure it out

    This should give a 64-bit library with no problems...

  Unknown Error:
    libfenc_group_params.c:159: error: 'param_buf' undeclared (first use in this function)
